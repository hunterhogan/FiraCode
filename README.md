# Fira Code by Nikita Prokopov [@nikitonsky](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky)

Nikita "tonsky" Prokopov created Fira Code: "a free monospaced font containing ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations."

## New compiled versions

As of 2026 February 8, the last compiled version was released on 2021 December 6. Since then, however, Mr. Prokopov has added to his excellent work.

In this fork of his repository, I have compiled the latest version of Fira Code. If he were to create a new release, you should certainly prefer his version. I do not want to replace him or his work: Fira Code is easily my favorite programming font. I cannot replace him: I do not have the skills to make a font.

## [Integrated Code 火](https://github.com/hunterhogan/Integrated_code_fire_font)

Integrated Code 火 is a code-centric font combining an up-to-date [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) compile with a modified [Source Han Mono](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-mono) compile. The Source™ Han glyphs are exactly twice the width of Fira Code glyphs, and the Source Han characters are slightly more spread out than you would expect to see in normal text.

（机器翻译） Integrated Code 火是一款以代码为核心的字体，融合了最新的[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)字形与改良版[Source Han Mono](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-mono)字形。Source™ Han字符的宽度恰好是Fira Code字符的两倍，且Source Han字符的间距比常规文本中常见的略微宽松。
